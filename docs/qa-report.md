# QA report

Verified locally on 2026-11-03, Python 3.12.14 and Node 24.22.1.

- 15 deterministic unit/transport tests passed. Includes unknown-vs-negative evidence, provenance/metrics edge cases, CSV injection escaping, rate-limit handling, host validation, cache provenance and pagination truncation.
- Public-data collection completed with zero reported source errors for the bundled sample.
- Offline analysis runs against the committed snapshot without credentials.
- TypeScript and Vite production build checked before publication.
- No raw API cache, credentials, personal emails or SQLite database is included in the published tree. Source URLs and response hashes accompany derived observations.
- Remote CI and Vercel deployment status are separate from these local checks. No Vercel deployment is claimed.

See methodology and limitations for research interpretation. A passing software test suite does not validate causal inference or make the sample representative.

## Publication verification

Code publication verified at commit `6fe6695a6e8be08494f991ae8889e60794620232`. [GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/yeabsira-mesfin/React-/actions/runs/41731517207) completed successfully. 15 local tests passed for this project, in addition to the documented experimental fixture outcomes.

Browser interaction and responsive-layout QA remain unverified: the available browser could not reach the local preview server. TypeScript checks and Vite builds passed; those do not substitute for browser checks.

Repository renaming requires GitHub Settings access, which the connected code tool does not provide. The current repository name and visibility remain unchanged. Vercel configuration is committed; no new Vercel deployment was performed.
